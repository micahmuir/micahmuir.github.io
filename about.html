        <p>
          I exist at the intersection of many worlds. I was born in South Africa and grew up in
          Oregon, Singapore, Scotland, and California. My heritage reflects a mix of cultures—
          my mother is Caucasian, my father was half Black and half Japanese, and my grandmother
          was unconstitutionally interned at Heart Mountain during WWII.
        </p>

        <p>
          In school, I was “the artistic kid,” but I was equally driven by a deep scientific curiosity
          about how both I and the world worked. I earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a
          minor in Studio Art from Santa Clara University. Since then, I’ve worked in robotics,
          product design, and art.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently a mechanical engineer at Lab0, developing a robotic full-system solution
          for unpacking, transporting, and palletizing inbound product. My projects have ranged
          from autonomous vision systems, to large-scale robotic structures, to interactive
          art installations. Across all of these, my curiosity and eclectic interests allow
          my work and art to inform one another.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned to code not as an end in itself, but as a way to leverage engineering to create
          a kind of magic. Years of frugal innovation have taught me to redefine what’s possible
          with limited resources, blending practicality with imagination.
        </p>
