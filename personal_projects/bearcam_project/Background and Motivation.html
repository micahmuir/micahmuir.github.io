I don’t know what it was. But it scratched an itch I couldn’t quite explain. Skyscraper sized rabbits with entire human crews manning from the brain cockpit. Human sized android robot rabbits that handled domestic labour. Valiant adventurer bunnies dutifully exploring the most dangerous areas of space. I’ll need to dig out some of the old journals where you’d see this cutaways of all the hypothetical mechanisms I thought a cyborg rabbit would operate. That was back when I thought engineers only worked on trains. <br/><br/>Anyways. I’ve been wanting for a general purpose vision platform for future ideas and experiments I may get up to. I wanted something that was easily expandable, upgradeable, and serviceable. I have a DSLR, but I wanted a camera system that was more or less custom to my needs. And those needs include being a robust, high-ish (30 fps ideally) camera system I could treat as a sort of “vision” component to a wide range of future projects. <br/><br/>Beyond that, a couple of things happened in close proximity to each other that enabled this rabbit hole. At work, we were testing some very low-cost ToF cameras for possible industrial usage. We ultimately determined they wouldn’t fit the use case, but through testing, I learned how simple it was to work with a board level camera on a Raspberry Pi. </p><p id="27e9d96e-b8a1-802e-a6d1-d235b74f4cfd" class="">

The only problem was at the time, Arducam developers hadn’t adapted the their ToF camera to the newest Pi, so my dreams of a super low cost panoramic ToF camera were dashed… until a year later, when they released a firmware update that enabled usage with the Pi 5</p><p id="2749d96e-b8a1-80e8-a5f2-f65745d62f16" class=""><br/>It hit me that 20ish years later, I likely had all the skills necessary to realize a ridiculous phase-of-childhood dream, and create an actually useful tool at the same time.<br/><br/></p></div></details><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0">Wants/Requirements</summary><div class="indented"><ul id="2749d96e-b8a1-80c1-aa22-d7708874cf87" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Dual Camera</strong>.
